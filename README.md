# About

This reference defines and describes the interfaces, concept, symbols and procedures making up the Arcade Library Plug-able Common API (henceforth referred to as A.L.P-a.C.A). A.L.P-a.C.A is intended, in the context of the academic **[Arcade EPITECH project](https://intra.epitech.eu/module/2018/B-OOP-400/PAR-4-1/acti-322760/project/file/B-OOP-400_arcade.pdf)**, as a common API allowing the manipulation of various games and graphic libraries with the core program of this project. Any game library or graphic handler library following this API is therefore compatible with any core implementing it (save for platform incompatibilities). This APIâ€™s concepts are dependent on the use of the [dl library](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/dl-libraries.html) (or any system capable of faithfuly reproducing its behavior) in the implementation of the core.

## Libraries

A.L.P-a.C.A libraires implementation should follow the [A.L.P-a.C.A Libraries documentation](arcade_libraries.md).

## Entity File Format

Game libraries entities shall be defined by the [A.L.P-a.C.A Entity File Format](entity_file_format.md).

## Ressources Acquisition

Libraries ressources locations shall be defined by the [RAFH](RAFH.md)
